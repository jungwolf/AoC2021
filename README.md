# AoC2021
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event starting on December 1st and finishing on the 25th. Each day has a two part puzzle framed within a story. Solve part1 and you get a star and access to part2. Solve part2 and get another star! Many people find the puzzles to be interesting little programming challenges. There are many ways to approach AoC and I recommend checking out the site. Have fun!

Last year I used SQL for the most part. I'll probably do the same but take a more liberal view towards using pl/sql.
