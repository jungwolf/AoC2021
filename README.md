# AoC2021
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a yearly event starting on December 1st and finishing on the 25th. Each day has a two part puzzle framed within a story. Solve part1 and you get a star and access to part2. Solve part2 and get another star! Many people find the puzzles to be interesting little programming challenges. There are many ways to approach AoC and I recommend checking out the site. Have fun!

[Home page](https://adventofcode.com/2021) for this year, 2021.

I'll put some amount of explaination of my solution in each day's README.md file. Last year I used Oracle SQL for the most part. I'll probably do the same but take a more liberal view towards using pl/sql. **I assume you are familiar with sql to some degree.**
