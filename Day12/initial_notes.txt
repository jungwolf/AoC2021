how about (from, to, fromonce) where fromonce is 0 for bigs and 1 for small
some idea about using sum(fromonce)>0 as a limit for small caves
hmm, big1 -> big2 is fine, but big2 back to big1 seems suspect
  not an issue, example and part1 don't have big to big links

recursive queries are an extention of hierarchical queries, so seem like a good fit.
avoid cycles...
